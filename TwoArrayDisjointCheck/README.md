                            How to check if two given sets are disjoint
                            
Given two sets represented by two arrays, how to check if the given two sets are disjoint or not? It may be assumed that the given arrays have no duplicates.

Input: set1[] = {12, 34, 11, 9, 3}
       set2[] = {2, 1, 3, 5}
Output: Not Disjoint
3 is common in two sets.

Input: set1[] = {12, 34, 11, 9, 3}
       set2[] = {7, 2, 1, 5}
Output: Yes, Disjoint
There is no common element in two sets.
