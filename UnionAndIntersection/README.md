                                                Union And Intersection
Given two Linked Lists, create union and intersection lists that contain union and intersection of the elements present in the given lists. Order of elements in output lists doesnâ€™t matter. Examples:

Input:
   List1: 10 -> 15 -> 4 -> 20
   List2: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 10
Output:
   Intersection List: 4 -> 10
   Union List: 2 -> 8 -> 20 -> 4 -> 15 -> 10
Explanation: In this two lists 4 and 10 nodes 
are common. The union lists contains 
all the nodes of both the lists.

Input:
   List1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
   List2: 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 10
Output:
   Intersection List: 3 -> 4
   Union List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 10
Explanation: In this two lists 4 and 3 nodes 
are common. The union lists contains 
all the nodes of both the lists.
