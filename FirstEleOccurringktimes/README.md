                                            First Element Occurring K Times In An Array
                                            
Given an array of n integers. The task is to find the first element that occurs k number of times. If no element occurs k times the print -1. The distribution of integer elements could be in any range.
Examples: 

Input: {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}, k = 2 
Output: 7 
Explanation: Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 7 is the first that occurs 2 times. 

Input: {4, 1, 6, 1, 6, 4}, k = 1 
Output: -1
