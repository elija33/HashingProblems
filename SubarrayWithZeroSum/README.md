# HashingProblems

Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at least one) with 0 sum.

Examples: 

Input: {4, 2, -3, 1, 6}
Output: true 
Explanation:
There is a subarray with zero sum from index 1 to 3.

Input: {4, 2, 0, 1, 6}
Output: true
Explanation: The third element is zero. A single element is also a sub-array.

Input: {-3, 2, 3, 1, 6}
Output: false
