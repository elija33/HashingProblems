                                            Non-Overlapping Sum of Two Sets
                                            
Given two arrays A[] and B[] of size n. It is given that both array individually contains distinct elements. We need to find the sum of all elements that are not common.

Examples: 

Input : A[] = {1, 5, 3, 8}
        B[] = {5, 4, 6, 7}
Output : 29
1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 29

Input : A[] = {1, 5, 3, 8}
        B[] = {5, 1, 8, 3}
Output : 0
All elements are common.
