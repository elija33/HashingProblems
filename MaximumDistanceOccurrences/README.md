Given an array with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element.

Examples:  

Input : arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 2}
Output: 10

// maximum distance for 2 is 11-1 = 10 
// maximum distance for 1 is 4-2 = 2 
// maximum distance for 4 is 10-5 = 5
