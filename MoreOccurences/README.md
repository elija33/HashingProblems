                                                    More than n/k Occurences

Given an array of size n and an integer k, find all elements in the array that appear more than n/k times. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3}, k = 4
Output: {2, 3}
Explanation: Here n/k is 8/4 = 2, therefore 2 appears 3 times in the array that is greater than 2 and 3 appears 3 times in the array that is greater than 2

Input: arr[] = {9, 8, 7, 9, 2, 9, 7}, k = 3
Output: {9}
Explanation: Here n/k is 7/3 = 2, therefore 9 appears 3 times in the array that is greater than 2.
